## Work Day Scheduler
This work day scheduler was created as a project for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. It was created with starting code and is meant to showcase the skills we learned during the week such as jQuery, Bootstrap, and dayJS.

## Usage
This work day scheduler can be accessed at the following page: https://katgucilatar.github.io/work-day-scheduler
This quiz can also be downloaded through its files in the Github repository at this link: https://github.com/katgucilatar/work-day-scheduler
In order to access and edit the files, it is recommended to install VS Code or a similar application.

## Instructions
Upon opening the work day scheduler, the current date and time is shown at the top and compared to the timeblocks below it. Hours that are in the past will show up as gray, the present hour will show up as red, and the future hours will up as green. Each hour time block has a text area and save button in which the user can type their to-do's for the day and save it to local storage upon pressing the save button.
